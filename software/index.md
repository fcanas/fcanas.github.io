Duplicate Windows lets you clone any window on your Mac. It's like display mirroring or picture-in-picture for individual windows.

I developed Duplicate Windows as a teaching tool to show full-screen live code demos to a classroom while keeping private notes along side the demo on my laptop. After years of field-testing and a bit of extra polish, Duplicate Windows is available on the Mac App store.
