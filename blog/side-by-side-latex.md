% Side by Side Figures in LaTeX
% 2010-06-28

In another note to myself, here I describe how to put two figures side by side in LaTeX with the minipage environment. I know there are many other ways to do it, including the subfigure package, but I prefer minipage because each subfigure gets its own caption, labeling works like I want it to, and most of all the markup is easy to understand and extend. That is, itâ€™s easy to see how you can put three or four figures together, and I prefer that to other alternatives with an opaque command.

```latex
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure01.eps}
    \caption{The caption for figure 1}
    \label{fig:chapter001_dist_001}
  \end{minipage}
  \hspace{0.5cm}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure02.eps}
    \caption{The caption for figure 2.}
    \label{fig:chapter001_reward_001}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
```
