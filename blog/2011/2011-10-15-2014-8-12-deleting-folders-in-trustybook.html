<h1>Deleting Folders in TrustyBook</h1>
<date>2011-10-15</date>
<p>tldr; Try swiping across the folder in the list view. Or see the button in the next update.</p><p>It seems the most frequent confusion people have when using TrustyBook is how to delete folders. I’ve gotten a number of bad reviews because people think it can’t be done. The feature’s been in TrustyBook since I implemented folders, which was so long ago I don’t remember if it was after the first release, or when I was playing around with the original code on a train between Portland and Seattle, months before the world saw TrustyBook.</p><p>The general confusion this seems to have caused is really highlighted in John Gruber’s frequent likening of gestures to keyboard shortcuts (regarding <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/01/12/gestures-home-buttons.php">the home button</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/13/kneeland">close buttons</a>). If a feature is only accessible via a gesture, even if it’s a standardized gesture, it’s effective hidden. It’s interesting to think that all the people who didn’t know how to delete folders in TrustyBook likely don’t know about the widely-used swipe to delete gesture across all iOS apps.</p><p>I made a video demonstrating the swipe gesture in TrustyBook and put it on the app’s <a href="http://www.trustybook.com/support">support page</a>, which is linked directly from the app in the iTunes store. Since then I received three complaints, one in the form of a review, about the app’s inability to delete folders.</p><p>In an effort to keep the UI as simple as possible I originally omitted a button to delete a folder. I now realize that was a mistake. Usability should come above all else. So in a forthcoming update to TrustyBook, There will be a new button in the toolbar.</p>
