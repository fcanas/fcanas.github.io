What is is about any given object that you can take it in your hand, hold it, turn it around, look at it, scratch, feel, taste it… and then declare that it is a _____. How do we perceive something so we can categorize it, label it, and use it? 
<p>A great deal of work in categorization and object recognition begins with the premise that objects are somehow containers for enumerable features. We can interpret <em>things</em> as having have features like size, shape, weight, texture, etc. Given enough overlap in features between two objects, those objects may be considered part of the same category. For a time, it was popular to take enumerated lists of features of various objects and create taxonomies of objects, not unlike how biologists create taxonomies of living creatures (see the work of Elanor Rosch ~1973-1978). There was some evidence, mostly based on the time it takes to categorize objects, that people organize their internal representations of objects based on this sort of taxonomy.</p><p>A more successful approach in describing categorization behavior is based on psychological stimulus dimensions and values on those dimensions (Shepard, Nosofsky, etc.). Where appropriate, objects would have characteristics such as length, width, color, size of a blob on its side-any given object would have values on those dimensions and its position relative to other objects in the resulting psychological stimulus space determines similarity (in the figure below, color is used purely for illustrative purposes to match the objects with their corresponding points in <em>stimulus space</em>). Models based on this principle of object representation predicts categorization behavior remarkably well. But the origin of those dimensions, like the origin of features, seems to remain an open question.</p><p>It is unlikely that psychological dimensions, as regarded in the categorization literature, can be considered psychological primitives. Perhaps color, pitch of a sound, and temperature, are examples of physiologically privileged features, and are indeed primitive. But consider size. Size is often considered static and true because you can make repeatable observations that are self-consistent in the world outside the mind. You can measure an object, another person can do the same, and you will likely come to an agreement. But psychologically, size turns out not to be an absolute feature, but a feature defined by relationships. There doesn’t seem to be the equivalent of “<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch">absolute pitch</a>” for estimates of size and distance. I can hand you a stick, have you interact with your environment with the stick, and your estimates of distance will shrink because your image of your own body has grown to encompass the stick.</p><p>When we start considering what defines any natural category (that is not to say that it exists in Nature, but that it exists in our natural environment; so “chair” is a legitimate natural category here), enumerable features fall apart in many cases. There are some classic examples that feel like perfectly legitimate first-class categories that defy description by anything other than relationships. The philosopher <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a> proposes the category “Game” as a concept that isn’t defined by any particular feature, but by social context. And psychologist Lawrence Barsalou proposes “food you can throw” as a category which we’ve never been explicitly taught, but is trivial to mentally populate the first time you hear it as a category label — we construct it based on an action, and a simulated relationship with our own bodies, and maybe even the target we’re mentally throwing the food at.</p><p>Especially “food you can throw” can be called a goal-based category, but I think goal-based categories encompass a much larger set of the categories we interact with on a daily basis. The often-debated categorical definition of a chair, I feel, is best resolved by its goal-based definition. On asking people what makes up a chair, the tendency to begin enumerating visual features is remarkable, in that the first thing they respond “has four legs” is quite simply and obviously wrong as a defining characteristic of the category. People interact with chairs with fewer than four legs on a fairly regular basis. It is both easier and more consistent to conceptualize a chair simply as something you can imagine yourself sitting on.</p><p>But in the taxonomy of the sorts of categories there are in the world, relation-based categories seem like they could be at the root of it all. It even seems that two objects entering a relationship colors their identity to overtake their enumerable features. The most striking example of this effect being that under some not-so-contrived circumstances, a penguin is judged as being more similar to a seal than to a penguin <a target="_blank" href="http://matt.colorado.edu/jones-love_roles.pdf">(Jones & Love 2007)</a>. So if we recast goal-based categories to be a special case of role-based categories, where one of the agents is ourselves and therefore encompasses our goals, we can see the pervasiveness of relationships in various sorts of object identity questions.</p><p><strong>Possible directions for next time:</strong></p><ol><li>how to build something from nothing, and why we need to</li><li>what exactly do i mean by “relations all the way down”?</li><li>what’s at the bottom?</li><li>does “you are the center of your universe. and the universe is your bottle opener” have anything to do with this?</li><li>that’s great, but how will this science impact <em>me</em>. you know. like. cell phones?</li></ol></p></article></main></body></html>
