</pre><h2>ARC</h2><p>Automatic reference counting (ARC) is a good thing. It’s a great compile-time technology that makes it easier, in most cases, to not accidentally introduce trivial memory leaks in modern Objective-C apps.</p><p>But sometimes, you have older code with traditional memory management; it’s not really worth converting to ARC if it’s correct, and possibly finely tuned. And sometimes ARC introduces <a href="http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/2013/03/confirmed-arc-slow/">a little unnecessary overhead</a> that can balloon out of control when handling large numbers of objects. There are also good reasons to put Objective-C objects into structs or other odd places that ARC prohibits or makes difficult (Objective-C++ anyone?).</p><p>That said, ARC is almost always a good idea. And so disabling ARC should be the exception, not the rule.</p><h2>CocoaPods</h2><p><a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> is an excellent dependency management system for Objective-C projects. Dependencies are distributed as ‘Pods’ which are described in podpecs. A podspec is a kind of build description, that specifies where the source is to be found, dependencies it has, and how it should be configured and compiled.</p><p>CocoaPods lets you specify ARC on a spec or subspec basis, but doing so on a per-file basis is not planned for the spec DSL. The <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/589#issuecomment-9350801">suggested way of doing this</a> is a little unsatisfactory because it has you listing each file to exclude twice. Luckily we’re working with ruby and we can just extract the list of files to exclude into a list we can use to exclude from the sources and include in a non-ARC subspec.</p></article></main></body></html>
