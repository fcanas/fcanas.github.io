It’s available on <a href="https://github.com/fcanas/SafeCast">GitHub</a>.</p><h2>The Story</h2><p>Somewhere on the web I took a quiz to determine how well I know Objective-C. One question&shy;infuriated me at the time asked something like  “if you have an array <code>NSArray *a</code>, how&shy;do you make it an <code>NSMutableArray</code>?” The answer was supposedly</p><pre>NSMutableArray *mutableArray = (NSMutableArray *)a;
</pre><p>But this is tremendously dangerous, wrong, crazy… The real answer is something like</p><pre>NSMutableArray *mutableArray = [a mutableCopy];
</pre><p>Unless you want to actually modify the same instance that <code>a</code> is <em>if</em> it’s a mutable array,&shy;in which case you have to check whether it’s mutable.</p><pre>NSMutableArray *mutableArray;
if ([a isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]]) {
    mutableArray = a;
}
</pre><p>At which point you proceed to mutate <code>mutableArray</code>, which is also <code>a</code>, possibly ignoring the&shy;fact that <code>mutableArray</code> may be <code>nil</code>. Or maybe you return early if it’s <code>nil</code>.</p><h2>Casting is Dangerous</h2><p>If you cast between object that are the same foundational type, no work is done. What I&shy;mean is that if you cast from an float to an int, since they’re represented differently in&shy;the machine, some work is done to represent that float as a int that changes the value&shy;you’re working with.</p><p>In Objective-C, when we’re dealing with objects, we’re dealing with pointers to objects.&shy;These are really <em>just</em> pointers. They represent a memory address, not a real usable&shy;value. So if you cast an <code>NSArray</code> to an <code>NSMutableArray</code>, nothing happens. Same if you&shy;case an object to an <code>int *</code>. (Which is coincidentally prohibited by ARC. Before ARC,&shy;casting an object to an <code>int *</code> used to be perfectly valid, if usually insane.)</p><p>Almost every time I see a cast involving an Objective-C object, I get very worried.&shy;Objective-C has a type system and a compiler that does its best to enforce correct types.&shy;We should use it. Our compiler helps us move finding bugs from run time to compile time.&shy;Casting is a way to tell the compiler “don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” But I’ve seen&shy;too many cases of people not knowing what they’re doing. They forget that method&shy;signatures specify a more general type for a reason. If you are passed an object with type&shy;<code><MyProtocol></code>, you shouldn’t even assume you’re working with an NSObject. And if you’re&shy;passing around raw <code>id</code>s all the time, you should strongly consider coming up with good&shy;protocols. Or maybe you’re taking a parameter that may be one of two very distinct types&shy;you say? Well that’s certainly odd, but I hope you’re at least doing the Objective-C&shy;casting dance.</p><h2>Getting Rid of the Casting Dance</h2><p>I wrote the casting dance out above. But here it is again with a little more detail.</p><pre>NSMutableArray *ma;
if ([a isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]]) {
    // You have a mutable array!
    ma = a;
} else {
    // You don't have a mutable array!
}
// `ma` is `nil` if `a` wasn't originally an `NSMutableArray`
</pre><p>I want to get rid of that, and many things like it. So this project aims to reduce the&shy;above down to this</p><pre>NSMutableArray *ma = [NSMutableArray cast:a];
// `ma` is `nil` if `a` wasn't originally an `NSMutableArray`
</pre><h3>Conditional Code</h3><p>Often what we really want to do is run certain code if an object is of a specific type.</p><pre>if ([a isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]]) {
    NSMutableArray *ma = a;
    [ma addObject:x];
}
</pre><p>Technically, this could have the same effect</p><pre>[[NSMutableArray cast:a] addObject:x];
</pre><p>Practically, this ends up getting more complex. Likely I will want to include ways of running a block with the passed object if the object is the kind that’s expected. Maybe something like</p><pre>[NSMutableArray cast:a intoBlock:^(NSMutableArray *ma){
    [ma addObject:x];
    [ma addObject:y];
    [ma addObject:z];
}];
</pre><p>or even</p><pre>BOOL success = [NSMutableArray cast:a intoBlock:^(NSMutableArray *ma){
    [ma addObject:x];
    [ma addObject:y];
    [ma addObject:z];
}];
if (!success){
    // Do whatever it is you need to do if `a` is not mutable...
}
</pre><h2>But what’s the point?</h2><h3>Conciseness</h3><p>It is more concise, while also being idiomatic.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Every Objective-C programmer knows how to cast. Sadly, many don’t understand that it&shy;doesn’t give you any guarantees. It just tells the compiler “shut up, I know what I’m&shy;doing”. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18043971/fast-enumeration-does-not-give-correct-object-type-in-objective-c'>Here’s at least one example more related to fast enumeration</a>.&shy;But surely you’ve explained this sort of thing to somebody in the past? It’s an honest&shy;enough mistake to make.</p><p>It’s too easy to gloss over the casting dance, correct code that looks very familiar (and&shy;if and a cast), and not realize that there’s a <em>very</em> important technical decision&shy;being made there. I would rather somebody come across a weird cast: method in my code base&shy;and ask why it’s there. Then I can go on about the dangers of casting.</p><h3>Clarity</h3><p>The closer that code can read to prose the better the intent of the programmer can be&shy;understood. It also means that there’s fewer places for bugs to creep in. Consider doing&shy;something with items in an array.</p><pre>NSArray *a;
for (int i = 0; i < a.count; i++) {
    NSLog(@"%@", a[i]);
}
</pre><p>Then fast enumeration came along, and off-by-one and out-of-bounds errors became rarer.</p><pre>NSArray *a;
for (id object in a) {
    NSLog(@"%@", object);
}
</pre><p>And I even prefer block enumeration sometimes.</p><pre>NSArray *a;
[a enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
    NSLog(@"%@", a);
}];
</pre><p>This is especially helpful when dealing with other collection types. Some people don’t&shy;know off the top of their heads whether fast enumeration of a dictionary iterates over&shy;objects or keys.</p><h2>Digress and Reflect</h2><p>With all the recent chatter about Apple needing to <a href='http://ashfurrow.com/blog/we-need-to-replace-objective-c'>replace Objective-C</a>,&shy;one common call is to move away from C. That “we’re one NULL pointer dereference away&shy;from a crash”. I don’t remember the last time code I’ve worked closely with crashed from&shy;a NULL pointer dereference. It happens when you’re using C language features, and most&shy;code where you can’t avoid C is code that belongs in C (image manipulation, DSP).&shy;I think it’s clear that the very best Objective-C developers need to know and love C&shy;inside and out. But you can make a lot of pretty solid apps without knowing much about C.</p><p>I think it’s <em>much</em> more common for an app to crash with unrecognized selector sent&shy;to instance. And here’s why I brought up the “Apple needs to drop Objective-C” thing.&shy;Objective-C is remarkable for its powers of introspection and runtime manipulation.</p></article></main></body></html>
