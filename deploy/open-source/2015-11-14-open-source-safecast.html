<ul>
<li>Cast objects in Objective-C, not in C</li>
<li>Enumerate objects in collections only if they're of a certain kind, or conform to a protocol</li>
<li>Be Safe</li>
<li>Be Concice</li>
</ul>

<p>Objective-C is C, and C is perilous. Don't blindly cast objects. Stick to high-level language features, and write more readable code.</p>

<p>Quite simply, you can do things like this:</p>

<pre>
NSMutableArray *mArray = [NSMutableArray safe_cast:array];
// `mArray` is nil if `array` is not a mutable array, or `array` if it is.
</pre>

<p>Or only call methods on collection members that can respond to the selector.</p>

<pre>
[array safe_makeObjectsSafelyPerformSelector:@selector(method)];
</pre>

<p>Or enumerate with a block on objects that are of a specific kind.</p>

<pre>
[array safe_enumerateObjectsOfKind:[MyObject class]
                        usingBlock:^(MyObject *obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
                            [obj setNumber:@3];
                        }];
</pre>

<p>Or a protocol</p>

<pre>
[array safe_enumerateObjectsConformingToProtocol:@protocol(MyProtocol)
                                      usingBlock:^(id<MyProtocol> *obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
                                          [obj setNumber:@3];
                                      }];
</pre>

<p>SafeCast has quite a few methods like this, covering <code>NSArray</code>, <code>NSSet</code>, <code>NSDictionary</code>, and <code>NSOrderedSet</code>.</p>

<p>I doubt it would be a good idea to give coverage to collections like <code>NSMapTable</code> or <code>NSHashTable</code>, so that's not planned.</p>

<h2 id="awholelibraryfor_that_">A Whole Library for <em>that</em>?</h2>

<p>Well, first of all, it's <em>really</em> small. The documentation in the headers is <em>much</em> bigger than the code. And it's tested. You may not need it. But it has a lot of things going for it.</p>

<h3 id="easytointegrate">Easy to integrate</h3>

<p>SafeCast is available as a <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">CocoaPod</a>.</p>

<pre>
pod 'SafeCast'
</pre>

<h3 id="beconciceanddirectwithyourintent">Be concice and direct with your intent</h3>

<p>It definitely takes fewer lines of code. In my opinion it's easier to read and think about than the more verbose, way of doing it safely. It keeps your type-safety checks up front and at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="besafe">Be Safe</h3>

<p>Maybe you know what you're doing. But do you always do the right thing? How many people are in your code base? And how well do they all know Objective-C's C underbelly? More and more developers are coming in having worked with higher-level or dynamic languages, and may not realize what's safe and what's not.</p>

<p>SafeCast wants to make it easier to safely cast ... to cast only when it's safe to do so.</p>
