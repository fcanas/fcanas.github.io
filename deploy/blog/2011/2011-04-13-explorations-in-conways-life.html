<h1>Explorations in Conway's Life</h1>
<date>2011-04-13</date>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway">Conway’s Game of Life</a> is a set of rules for a a cellular automata, an infinite lattice of cells that are either alive or dead at any step in time. A few simple rules form the basis for an entire universe of possibilities.</p><p>From Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><ol><br /><li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li><br /><li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li><br /><li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li><br /><li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li><br /><br /> </ol></blockquote><p>I came back to it to explore its potential as a virtual world for virtual agents to develop knowledge representations. I made a simple implementation in <span>MATLAB</span> to calculate a single time step:</p>
<pre>function grid = life(grid)
% 	LIFE outputs the next step to a game of life
% 		[GRID] = LIFE
%
% 	Outputs the next step of conway’s life
%

% Number of neighbors:
neighbors = conv2(grid,[1 1 1; 1 0 1; 1 1 1],'same’);

% Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
grid(neighbors&lt;2) = 0;

% Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
grid(neighbors&gt;3) = 0;

% Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
grid(neighbors==3) = 1;

% Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
% free
end % function
</pre>

<p>Below is a standard visualization of a form called “Diehard”, so named because it has a lifespan of 130 steps, remarkable for a pattern with just 7 live cells to start:</p>



<p>The real fun starts when I take each time step from a run and layer it on top of the previous one, creating a three-dimensional representation of the beast.</p><p>If you want to play with the source, it’s shown below.</p><p>I use inject as a utility to paste from a library of patterns into the “world” :</p>
<pre>
function grid = inject(grid,pattern,x,y)
  % 	INJECT inject pattern into grid at position x, y
  % 		[GRID] =
  %
  % 	inject pattern into grid at position x, y
  %

  [w,h] = size(pattern);
  grid(x:(x+w-1),y:(y+h-1))=pattern;
end % function
</pre>

<p>And here’s the script that generates the animation above:</p>
<pre>
diehard = [ ...
  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0; ...
  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0; ...
  0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1; ...
];
g = zeros(30);
g = inject(g,diehard,15,15);

fg = g;
figure
while (true)
  gp = life(g);
  if gp==g
    break;
  end
  g = gp;
  fg = cat(3,fg,g);
end

h = patch(isosurface(fg));

axis equal
axis off

light('Position’,[-2,2,20])
lighting phong
material([0.4,0.6,0.5,30])
set(h,'EdgeAlpha’,0)
set(h,'FaceColor’,[0.2 0.5 0.1],...
      'BackFaceLighting’,'lit’)
drawnow
set(gcf, 'Position’, [552 -17 200 801])
for i=0:179
  view([i 0])
  print(gcf, '-dtiff’, '-r100’, sprintf('image_%04d’, i));
  drawnow
end<
</pre>

<p>Incidentally, I also worked out a few compact versions of Life in <span>MATLB</span>. The shortest of the two weights in at 85 characters, but runs indefinitely. The second outputs only nine steps to the console, which is about as long a run as you’re likely to get given a random 9×9 grid:</p>

<pre>
g=rand(9)&gt;.5;p=ones(3);p(5)=0;while(1)n=conv2(double(g),p,'same’);g=(n==3|g&amp;n==2),end
</pre>
<pre>
g=rand(9)&gt;.5;p=ones(3);p(5)=0;for(i=[1:9])n=conv2(double(g),p,'same');g=(n==3|g&amp;n==2),end
</pre>

<p>The longer of the three is more fun and actually draws the grid to a window. It’s still lightweight at 105 characters. It too runs until you kill it:</p>

<pre>
g=rand(25)&gt;.5;p=ones(3);p(5)=0;while(1)n=conv2(double(g),p,'same');g=(n==3|g&amp;n==2);imagesc(g);drawnow;end
</pre>
